A camera is basically an enclosed hollow, 
with an opening or aperture at one end for 
light to enter, and a recording or viewing 
surface for capturing the light at the other 
end.

“Pinhole Cameras” are easily made 
with an empty can painted black, made 
lightproof. Photo paper or negative film 
can be used as recording surface.

The single-lens reflex (SLR) is a type of 
camera that uses a movable mirror placed 
between the lens and the film (or sensor) to 
project the image seen through the 
lens to a focusing 
screen
mirror 
Film or 
sensor 
This feature separates SLRs from other cameras, 
as the photographer sees the image composed 
exactly as it will be captured on the film or sensor.
There is no parallax 
error, and exact focus 
can be confirmed by 
eye.

The Digital SLR Camera
Ergonomically, Digital SLRs have followed their 
35mm predecessors, but although the 
principles might be the same, the inner 
workings of a digital camera are quite different.
Instead of film, a digital camera has a sensor that 
converts light into electrical charges.
The image sensor employed by most digital 
cameras is a charge coupled device (CCD). 
Some cameras use complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor (CMOS) technology instead. Both 
CCD and CMOS image sensors convert light into 
electrons. 
Numerous differences exist between the two 
sensors but they both play the same role in the 
camera – they turn light into electricity. 
For the purpose of understanding how a digital 
camera works, you can think of them as nearly 
identical devices. 
Camera Resolution
The amount of 
detail that the 
sensor in the 
camera can capture 
is called resolution.
Resolution is 
measured in pixels 
(a megapixel is 1 
million pixels ). 
The higher the megapixels, 
the sharper and more detailed 
the pictures your digital 
camera can take, and the 
bigger you can enlarge them 
without losing the sharpness. 
Pixels are tiny little pieces of an image.
Resolution (megapixel) / Print Size (inches)
The most important thing to understand about resolution is 
the relationship between an image's resolution (ppi) and an 
image's print size (actual width and height in inches).
High-end consumer cameras can capture 
over 12 million pixels. Some professional 
cameras support over 21 million pixels, or 39 
million pixels for medium format cameras. 
(Hasselblad)
21.1 Megapixel
39 Megapixel
For comparison, Hewlett Packard estimates that the 
quality of 35mm film is about 20 to 25 million pixels.
When buying a Digital Camera make sure it 
has enough MegaPixels for the size you 
intend to print at 300ppi (pixels per inch). 
Simply divide the number of pixels 
width/height by 300 to know the size you will 
get in inches
Always set your camera 
to the highest resolution/ 
lowest compression 
possible, as you can 
make them smaller later, 
but never the opposite.
File Format
A file format is a particular way to encode 
information for storage in a computer file.
Briefly, in photography, the most important for 
general purposes today are TIFF and JPG 
(“jaypeg”). 
On the web, JPG is the best choice (smallest 
file) for photo images. 
Professionally, TIFF files are recommended.
The file format you choose can impact the clarity 
of the photo. A number of digital cameras offer 
both TIFF and JPEG settings:
TIFF: This file format is uncompressed. 
Choosing TIFF means that you're always 
assured of getting all the image quality captured 
and processed by the camera. 
TIFF files can be quite large, which means that 
only a few will fit onto a memory card. They can 
also take a while to be written to the card, which, 
with some cameras, means it might be a few 
seconds before you can take another picture. 
JPEG: This file format is compressed, 
which means that the picture information is 
squeezed to a smaller size before it's stored on 
the memory card. 
Though this compression does not alter the 
photo's resolution, it does come at the expense 
of a slight loss of detail and clarity in the photo. 
Typically, a camera will offer several JPEG 
settings, each offering progressively more 
compression (which translates into being able 
to store more photos on the memory card), with 
a commensurate drop in image quality. 
Fortunately, the highest-quality, lowest-
compression JPEG setting on most cameras 
offers fractionally less quality than TIFF, but 
without the headaches of really large photo files. 
In fact, few photographers ever notice the 
difference between a best-quality JPEG and 
TIFF, even though the JPEG will be six to eight 
times smaller when stored on the card. The 
same can't be said of the lower-quality JPEG 
settings—clarity and detail can drop off fast.
For the best image quality and the ability to 
readjust the camera settings after the event, 
nothing beats RAW.
RAW: Unlike JPEG and TIFF, RAW is 
not an abbreviation but literally means "raw" as 
in "unprocessed". 
A RAW file contains the original image 
information as it comes off the sensor before  
in-camera processing so you can do that 
processing afterwards on your PC with special 
software.
Original information includes (depending on the 
camera) sharpening level, contrast and 
saturation settings, colour temperature / white 
balance, and so on.
Internally, computers convert words, pictures, 
sounds, or any other medium that enters it's 
world into numbers. 
Computers don't use decimal numbers. They 
use binary digits that consist of only zeros and 
ones {0,1}, "bits" for short.
A bit is the smallest unit of data. It can be 1 or 
0, black or white, on or off. 
8 bits comprise a byte. A byte can therefore 
represent 256 different states.
Images like photographs are usually composed of 
8-bit (grayscale), 24-bit (RGB), or even higher bit-
depth pixels. 
More bits per pixel also leads to larger image 
files.
Grayscale (8 bit)
RAW (12 to 16 bit) 
per Channel = up to
48 bit
An RGB image has 3 channels, so 
at 8 bits per channel (24) has an 
accuracy of of 16.7 million possible 
colours. 
A RAW file has up to 16 bits per 
channel (48). A 48 bit image is 
capable of billions of colours.

Focus
Focusing is the moving 
of the lens in and out 
until the sharpest 
possible image of the 
subject is projected onto 
the film or sensor. 
Focusing points
Cameras differ in the number of focusing 
points available. You can choose either or all 
off them depending on where the subject you 
want “on focus” is situated on the viewfinder.
AF lock
When the shutter release button is pressed 
halfway is it possible to “lock” the focus on your 
camera. 
Then holding the button halfway you can move 
your camera and compose your image and the 
focus will remain where you first selected it.
This way you don’t need to move your focusing 
point from the centre, what gives you control 
over what you want in focus without wasting so 
much time setting the focusing point for each 
picture. 
Focus exercise
| Camera on Auto. Compose the picture so that 
the subject is either in the left third or the right 
third of the picture. (This makes for pleasing 
pictures.) You will come back to this position.
| Move the camera right or left so the square 
brackets in the center of the viewfinder are over 
the actual subject.
| Press and hold the shutter button halfway down 
so the camera focuses on the subject. Keep 
your finger on the button
Slowly move your camera back to where you 
composed the picture in step 1. Press 
(squeeze) the shutter button all the way down. 
It may take some practice to do it right, but the 
results will be great! 
Single Auto-Focus
When you press the shutter button down 
halfway in this mode, the camera locks 
focus on whatever is in the center of the 
frame (or any other focal point you have 
selected) and maintains this focal point 
until either pressure on the shutter is 
released or until the shutter is pressed 
the rest of the way down. It is best to 
take pictures of relatively still subjects in 
this mode. 
Continuous Auto-Focus
When you press the shutter button down 
halfway in this mode, the camera will 
continue to focus on whatever is in the 
center of the frame (or other focal point 
selected) until the shutter is pressed the 
rest of the way down. Choose to shoot in 
this mode when either you or your 
subject is in motion to ensure sharp 
focus. 
Exposure
the total amount of light allowed to fall on 
the photographic medium (photographic 
film or image sensor) during the process 
of taking a photograph.
Exposure is controlled in a camera by a 
combination of the shutter speed and the 
illumination level by the lens aperture.

ISO
APERTURE
SHUTTER SPEED
The "correct" exposure for a photograph is 
determined by the sensitivity of the medium 
used. For photographic film, sensitivity is 
referred to as film speed and is measured on a 
scale published by the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO).
Since digital cameras do not use film but use 
image sensors instead, the ISO equivalent is 
usually given. 
What ISO denotes is how sensitive the image 
sensor is to the amount of light present. The 
higher the ISO, the more sensitive the image 
sensor and therefore the possibility to take 
pictures in low-light situations
However when you increase ISO you can also 
increase the noise, which is the digital 
equivalent of film grain. It can even look like 
grain, though more often it looks more like ugly 
speckles or color artifacts. 
Shutter Speed
‘the amount of time that the 
shutter is open’
Aperture
The smaller the number, the larger the aperture
More light      Less light
An important thing to remember while setting 
the values is reciprocity. If one exposes the film 
or sensor for a longer period, a reciprocally 
smaller aperture is required to reduce the 
amount of light hitting the film to obtain the 
same exposure, and vive-versa.

Light Meter
A light meter allows the photographer to 
determine which shutter speed and f-number
(aperture) should be selected for an optimum 
exposure, given a certain lighting situation and 
film speed.

Ultimately there is no such thing as "correct 
exposure", as a scene can be exposed in many 
ways, depending on the desired effect a 
photographer wishes to convey. 
Metering modes
Spot metering
With spot metering, the camera will only 
measure a very small area of the scene 
(between 1-5% of the viewfinder area). 
Spot metering is very accurate and is not 
influenced by other areas in the frame. It is 
commonly used to shoot very high contrast 
scenes. For example, if the subject's back is 
being hit by the rising sun and the face is a lot 
darker than the bright halo around the subject's 
back and hairline (the subject is "backlit"), spot 
metering allows the photographer to measure 
the light bouncing off the subject's face and 
expose properly for that, instead of the much 
brighter light around the hairline. The area 
around the back and hairline will then become 
over-exposed. 
Center-weighted average 
metering
In this system, the meter concentrates between 
60 to 80 percent of the sensitivity towards the 
central part of the viewfinder. The balance is 
then "feathered" out towards the edges. 
One advantage of this method is that it is less 
influenced by small areas that vary greatly in 
brightness at the edges of the viewfinder; as 
many subjects are in the central part of the 
frame, consistent results can be obtained.
Average metering
In this metering mode the camera will use the 
light information coming from the entire scene 
and averages for the final exposure setting, 
giving no weighting to any particular portion of 
the metered area.
Partial area metering
This mode meters a larger area than spot 
metering (around 10-15% of the entire frame), 
and is generally used when very bright or very 
dark areas on the edges of the frame would 
otherwise influence the metering unduly. Like 
spot metering, some cameras can use variable 
points to take readings from, (in general 
autofocus points), or have a fixed point in the 
centre of the viewfinder. Partial metering is 
found mostly on Canon cameras.
Multi-zone metering
This mode is also called matrix , evaluative , 
honeycomb , segment metering, or esp —
(electro selective pattern) metering on some 
cameras. 
Here the camera measures the light intensity in 
several points in the scene, and then combines 
the results to find the settings for the best 
exposure. How they are combined/calculated 
deviates from camera to camera. The actual 
number of zones used varies wildly, from 
several to over a thousand. 
Flash
Have you all noticed that the camera 
flash doesn’t pop up automatically on 
MANUAL mode, even in dark 
situations?
That’s because an “auto flash” could 
ruin any attempt of controlling shutter 
speed and aperture for the desired 
effect. 
Set the auto mode on your camera and 
see how it behaves with auto flash.
All we see are harsh shadows, red eyes, 
overexposed foreground, completely 
dark background, shiny skin.
So promise never, ever, turn your 
camera on Auto mode again. Thank you!
Flash light mimics day light, it can be 
seen as a reliable “portable” source of 
light.
And now let’s see how we can use our 
flash creatively. 
Almost all cameras have a 
built in flash. Although 
convenient, these flashes 
emit a hard flat light that 
creates shadows on the 
subject, have a short range, 
are prone to red eye. 
Built in Flash
External Flash
External flash unites 
are always more 
powerful than built-in 
flashes, but some 
have other advantages 
as well, especially 
those that zoom, tilt, 
and swivel.
Fill Flash
Fill Flash is used to supplement existing 
light in a scene - it’s generally not the 
primary light source (as a flash often is at 
night) but fills in light where natural light 
doesn’t go. 
It is very good when we have hash 
shadows or the foreground much darker 
than the background
Diffuse Light
A flash diffuser spreads the light from the 
flash of a camera. In effect, the light will not 
come from one concentrated source (like a 
spotlight), but rather will spread out, getting 
rid of harsh light, and hard shadows. 
This is particularly useful for portrait
photographers, since harsh light and hard 
shadows are usually not considered 
flattering in a portrait.
On camera flash diffuser
External flash diffuser
Bouncing Flash
Directing the flash 
to the ceiling (not 
too high) or a wall 
to reflect the light
Ring Flash
Sometimes the subject is 
so close to the lens 
(especially macro and 
medical photography) 
that the camera flash or 
external flash are out of 
reach. 
In these cases a ring 
flash is needed. 
Flash to freeze the movement
Flash provides a burst of light in a split 
second that will freeze even the fastest 
subject in its tracks. 
Science and research photographers use 
this to study movement, by photographing 
subjects such as bullets penetrating their 
target and nature and medical 
photographers to study anatomical changes 
maybe a horses gallop, athletes jump or 
hummingbirds wing motion. 
Flash with a slow shutter speed
The long exposure (or slow shutter speed) 
captures the background while the flash 
illuminates the foreground objects, along with 
some nice movement blur.
It works really well at parties when people are 
dancing, especially if you’re lucky to capture a 
laughing face while the body is in motion.
Shutter Speed
‘the amount of time that the 
shutter is open’
Shutter speed is measured in seconds - or in 
most cases fractions of seconds. The bigger the 
denominator the faster the speed (ie 1/1000 is 
much faster than 1/30).
Shutter speeds available to you on your camera 
will usually double (approximately) with each 
setting. As a result you’ll usually have the options 
for the following shutter speeds – 1/1000, 1/500, 
1/250, 1/125, 1/60, 1/30, 1/15, 1/8, 1/4etc. 
Some cameras also give you the option for very 
slow shutter speeds that are not fractions of 
seconds but are measured in seconds (for 
example 1 second, 10 seconds, 30 seconds etc). 
Shown on your camera as 1’, 10’, etc. 
Using very fast shutter speeds (1/1000, 
1/4000) "freeze" fast-moving subjects, such as 
birds in flight, passing cars or football players. 
Slow shutter speeds (1’, 1/4, 1/15, 1/30, are 
used to intentionally capture the movement of 
a subject.
In most cases you’ll probably be using shutter 
speeds of 1/80th of a second or faster. This is 
because anything slower than this is very 
difficult to use without getting camera shake. 
Camera shake is when your camera moves 
while the shutter is open and results in blur in 
your photos, and should not be mistaken for 
intentional blur.
Through practice and special techniques such 
as bracing the camera, arms, or body to 
minimize camera movement longer shutter 
speeds can be used without blur. If a shutter 
speed is too slow for hand holding, a camera 
support — usually a tripod — must be used.

The Eye
The Camera
Besides all the similarities of the optical 
aspects, the camera, like your eyes, has 
the power of expression.
From now on, the camera should be an 
extension of your eye. 
After understanding how to operate all 
mechanisms, getting the most of our 
lenses, shutter speeds, apertures and flash 
settings, we get to the most beautiful 
aspect of photography that is …
Composition
Placing the elements of your 
picture within the frame and 
deciding what to leave out. 
“Photography has not changed since it’s 
origin except in its technical aspects, which 
for me are not a major concern.
Photography appears to be an easy activity; 
in fact it is a varied and ambiguous process 
in which the only common denominator 
among its practitioners is their instrument.”
Henri Cartier Bresson
The 
Mind’s 
Eye
Henri Cartier Bresson
“In order to “give a meaning to
the world”, one has to feel 
oneself involved in what 
one frames trough 
the viewfinder.
This attitude requires 
concentration, 
a discipline of mind, 
sensitivity, and 
a sense of 
geometry.”
(Cartier Bresson)
Learning to see
The decision-making processes we 
make when taking a photograph starts 
first with being able to see 
possibilities. 
What we see depends on what we are 
interested in, what we are looking for 
and what our minds are prepared to 
show us. 
Seeing, in short, involves the mind 
and our memory as much as it does 
our eyes. 
Improving our visual sensitivity 
requires quieting our minds, relaxing, 
and preparing by learning as much as 
we can about our preferred subjects. 
Once we see 
things that are of 
interest, then we 
need to isolate 
parts of the 
scene, and 
organize the 
important visual 
elements within 
our viewfinder to 
effectively convey 
how we feel about 
them. 
A photograph is a “slice” of reality. 
The world around us has infinite 
possibilities of interpretation.
The way one takes photographs, is the 
way one sees the world. 
What do you want to say when you 
press the shutter release button ?
What do you want to show on your 
photographs?
Every photograph has edges that crop 
the scene from reality. 
The photographer must exclude 
certain visual elements, which already 
exist in their entirety, while selecting 
others to communicate a visual 
statement. 
The viewfinder becomes a kind of on-site 
editing tool searching out potential 
pictures with a virtually infinite amount of 
choices.
The photographer must learn to scan the 
entire picture space and become 
conscious of all the edges.
There are 3 basic ways to arrange 
the elements within your 
composition.
First:
Physically move objects relative to each other.
Only really works with still life photography.
Second:
Tell people to move relative to each other or 
other objects. 
Only works with people who can hear you.
And third:
MOVE! 
Usually the most effective way to control your 
composition is to alter YOUR viewpoint.
Lay on you belly!
Look Up!
Move up…
And down…
Get Close!

Golden Rules
| Rule of thirds, or Golden Ratio
| Golden Spiral
| Golden Triangles
Rule of Thirds or 
Golden Ratio 
The basic 
principle behind 
the rule of thirds 
is to imagine 
breaking an 
image down into 
thirds (both 
horizontally and 
vertically) so that 
you have 9 parts.
Instead of placing the main focus of interest in the 
centre of the frame, position it on an intersection of 
the thirds. 
Golden Spiral
If you continue 
constructing 
golden 
rectangles
inside other 
golden 
rectangles you 
end up with a 
spiral
There should be something, leading the eye to the 
center of the composition. It could be a line or several 
subjects.
GoldenTriangles
Another rule is  the 
"Golden 
Triangles". It's 
more convenient 
for photos with 
diagonal lines. 
There are three 
triangles with 
corresponding 
shapes. 
Just roughly 
place 
subjects in 
these 
triangles and 
this rule 
would be 
kept 
The Golden Ratio has 
been a profound 
influence since ancient 
times with Greeks 
utilizing the Golden 
Ratio in their buildings 
such as the Parthenon 
at the Temple of 
Athena on the 
Acropolis. 
Why do we like it?
During the 
Renaissance when 
European artists 
rediscovered the styles 
of the ancient world, 
the Golden Ratio was 
utilized for their 
sculptures and 
paintings. Leonardo da
Vinci is the most 
prominent Renaissance 
artist known to have 
used the Golden Ratio 
for great works such as 
the Mona Lisa.
Fibonacci Sequence
Leonardo Fibonacci was a well-traveled Italian who 
introduced the concept of zero and the Hindu-Arabic 
numeral system to Europe in 1200AD. 
He also described the Fibonacci sequence of numbers 
using an idealised breeding population of rabbits. 
Each rabbit pair produces another pair every month, 
taking one month first to mature, and giving the 
sequence 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,... Each number in the 
sequence is the sum of the previous two. 
If you construct a series of squares with 
lengths equal to the Fibonacci numbers 
(1,1,2,3,5, etc) and trace a line through the 
diagonals of each square, it forms a 
Fibonacci spiral.
Many examples 
of the Fibonacci 
spiral can be 
seen in nature, 
including in the 
chambers of a 
nautilus shell.
The ratio of consecutive numbers in the 
Fibonacci sequence approaches the golden 
ratio 
The aesthetically appealing ratio is found in 
much human architecture and plant life. A 
Golden Spiral formed in a manner similar to 
the Fibonacci spiral can be found by tracing 
the seeds of a sunflower from the centre 
outwards. 
Adolf Zeising, whose main interests were 
mathematics and philosophy, found the golden 
ratio expressed in the arrangement of branches 
along the stems of plants, and of veins in leaves.
He extended his research 
to the skeletons of animals 
and the branching of their 
veins and nerves, to the 
proportions of chemical 
compounds and the 
geometry of crystals, as 
well as the use of 
proportion in artistic 
endeavors. 
In these phenomena he 
saw the golden ratio 
operating as a universal 
law
The Golden Ratio (or Phi) occurs 
frequently in nature and it may be that 
humans are genetically programmed to 
recognize the ratio as being pleasing. 
Studies of top fashion models revealed 
that their faces have an abundance of the 
1.618 ratio.
Other composition 
ideas
The more you 
simplify a 
photo, the more 
attention you 
draw to your 
subject. 
Simplify 
Fill the frame
Get in as close 
as possible, 
eliminating 
anything in the 
background 
that may 
detract from 
your subject. 
Look for things 
such as 
doorways, 
bridges, signs 
and other things 
to frame your 
subject under. 
It gives a sense 
of perspective 
and intimacy to 
the image.
Framing within a frame
Henry Cartier-Bresson
Foreground Interest
Look for a viewpoint that includes some extra 
parts to your main subject and use these in the 
foreground. 
When framing the photo, place these extras 
near the bottom of the frame – remember, 
they’re just there to lead the eye into the photo, 
they’re not the main subject.
Try to capture the mood
Last rule: Break the rules!
The "rules" of composition should be considered as 
guidelines. They are based on recreating similarities 
in the make-up of many different images that many 
people have found to be esthetically-pleasing. 
Besides, some renowned photographs violate all the 
rules of composition and are still excellent pictures. 
Once you’ve got them in the back of your mind, 
throw everything away and create interesting images 
too.
Aperture
Your camera's aperture does two 
things. 
First, since we know that it controls 
the amount of light let into the 
camera, it also controls how dark or 
light your picture is going to be. 
Second, it controls how much of your 
picture is in focus. This is referred to 
as “depth of field”
After placing the plane of critical focus, you control 
how much of the area in front and behind that plane 
is in focus by adjusting the aperture.

Depth of Field
Depth of Field is a result of different parts 
of a scene coming into sharp focus at 
different points inside the camera.
Since the light 
forming these points 
is cone shaped, any 
point in the scene in 
front of or behind the 
plane of critical focus 
is projected onto de 
sensor as a circle, 
called circle of 
confusion, these 
circles increase in 
size the farther they 
are from the plane of

Circle of Confusion (CoC)
☺I am joking! ☺
please don’t get confused 
with circles of confusion
All you need to know is that your camera's 
aperture controls how large of a zone is 
acceptably in focus. 
The smaller (f/16, f/22) your camera's aperture, 
the larger that depth of field zone is. But beyond 
f/25, f/29 it starts loosing sharpness again.
Wide Aperture

To control depth of field you have 
th`ree factors to work with:

The smaller the size 
of the lens aperture 
(the larger the f-
number), the 
greater the depth of 
field. The larger the 
aperture, the 
shallower the depth 
of field.

subject distance:
as you move farther 
from the subject 
you are focused on 
you increase depth 
of field, as you 
move closer, you 
decrease it

Shorter focal 
length lenses 
increase depth of 
field and longer 
one decrease it. 
Quick guide:
Shallow Depth of Field
Using focus and aperture to emphasize 
one part of the image over another. 
Antonio Leanza
Shallow depth of field, sometimes called selective 
focus, is a great way to isolate a subject from a 
distracting background
Deep Depth of Field
Great depth of 
field is often 
desirable in 
landscapes and 
other scenes 
with great depth
Depth of Field Preview Button
When you compose an image on 
an SLR, the aperture is wide 
open so the viewfinder image is 
bright. 
To check the depth of field, after 
selective focus you press the 
depth of field preview button that 
closes the aperture to the one 
that will be used to take the 
photo, allowing you to check 
what will be sharp or not.
Lenses and Focal Length
The focal length of a lens determines 
its angle of view, and also how much 
the subject will be magnified for a 
given photographic position.
Prime Lenses
Prime or fixed focal length 
lenses are usually faster 
(have a wider aperture) 
than their zoom 
counterparts. 
A fast fixed focal length 
lens allows fast shutter 
speeds to be used in low-
light situations because of 
its large apertures. 
A wide aperture allows excellent subject 
isolation by blurring the distracting 
background. The results can be beautiful. 
Prime lenses have less optical elements 
inside, being “sharper” than zoom lenses 
and much less expensive. 
Zoom Lenses
The major 
advantage a 
zoom lens has is 
its versatility. 
A photographer 
using a zoom lens 
can quickly and 
properly frame 
and capture a 
fleeting 
opportunity. 
They can also capture 
many different 
framings of the same 
subject in seconds. A 
subject with a rapidly 
changing distance also 
favors a zoom lens. 
Zoom lenses require 
fewer lenses to carry. 
Lens changes 
sometimes are 
inconvenient, take time 
and allow dust to get to 
the sensor. 
Standard Lens (50 mm)
50mm length lens is regarded as standard  or 
"normal" because the image it makes is very close 
to what the human eye sees. 
A good 50mm lens is 
going to be sharper than 
practically any other focal 
length and it’s going to be 
free of apparent distortion. 
It is also generally the fastest available lens with 
just about all lens manufacturers, making f/1.4s 
and f/1.8s at good prices. 
Henri Cartier-Bresson, 
one of the greatest 
photojournalists of all 
times and certainly one of 
the photographers to raise 
photojournalism to the 
level of high art, reputedly 
used only the 50mm lens 
for everything from 
landscapes to portraiture. 
Wide Angle Lens
As their name suggests, these lenses enable their 
users to take shots with a very wide perspective. 
They are useful for landscapes and for getting in 
nice and close to subjects still fitting a lot of them 
in. 
The wider the angle of your lens, the more linear 
distortion you'll have in your image
Wide-angle lenses can be used to get in more 
subject - particularly useful when photographing 
interiors - or to enable you to get closer to a subject 
and still include it. 
Super Wide Angle (fish eye)
At the extreme end of the ‘wide angle’ range 
are ‘fisheye lenses’ which purposely distort your 
image in a curved way to get more into the 
shot. 
Telephoto Lenses
The focal length of a telephoto lens ranges from 
60 to 1000 mm. A telephoto lens magnifies the 
subject while at the same time narrowing the 
field of vision. 
These lenses create an image that looks flatter 
than that produced by a standard lens. 
Telephoto will make objects that are far away 
seem much closer. 
Telephotos are commonly used for wildlife 
photography. It's very difficult to get near many wild 
animals and birds,
A good wildlife photographer will take his 
or her telephoto lens out into the wild 
and sit, unmoving, for very long periods 
of time to get that great shot. 
Macro Lenses
These are special lenses designed for extreme 
close-up photography such as copy work, nature, 
medical photography, and an extended range of 
creative applications. .

considerations 
Most interchangeable-lens digital cameras today are in 
the form of 35 mm cameras. However, most of these 
cameras have photo sensors that are smaller than the 
image apertures of full-frame 35 mm cameras.
Therefore, the angle of view for any given focal length 
lens will be narrower than it would be in a full-frame 
camera because the smaller sensor "sees" less of the 
image projected by the lens. 
The camera manufacturers provide a crop factor
(sometimes called a field-of-view factor or a focal-length 
multiplier) to show how much smaller the sensor is than a 
full 35 mm film frame.
